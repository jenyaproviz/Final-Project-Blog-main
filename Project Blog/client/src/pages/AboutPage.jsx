          <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4">
I'm Jenya Proviz, a Full Stack Web Developer with a frontend focus, combining hands-on experience in modern web technologies with a solid background in industrial engineering and management.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4">
           I bring over a year of experience as a Junior Frontend Developer, where I contributed to financial software tools using React, TypeScript, Redux, and REST APIs. My work included building reusable UI components, implementing responsive templates, and optimizing performance for better user experience.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4">
            Before transitioning into tech, I spent 20+ years in production planning and procurement, leading complex workflows and process improvements in industrial environments. This experience sharpened my skills in problem-solving, systems thinking, and teamworkâ€”qualities I now apply to software development. <br />
            <br />
           My technical toolkit includes React, Redux, TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, SQL, Tailwind, and Bootstrap, alongside practical experience with tools like Jira, Figma, GitHub, and SendGrid.
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm passionate about building scalable, user-friendly solutions and continuously learning new technologies. Fluent in Hebrew and Russian, with strong English proficiency, I thrive in collaborative, multicultural teams.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-400 mb-4">
            Currently, I'm seeking opportunities as a Frontend or Full Stack Developer where I can grow, contribute, and create impactful solutions. <br />
